## Methodology for Patent Data Acquisition and Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Source Selection and Filtering
Patent data was sourced from Lens.org, a comprehensive global patent database. Strategic filters were applied to focus on autonomous vehicle technologies from major industry players: publication dates spanning 2020-2025, granted US patents with complete documentation (title, abstract, claims, description, full text), active legal status, and specific applicant companies including Baidu USA LLC, Ford Global Tech LLC, Amazon Tech INC, Qualcomm INC, Toyota Motor CO LTD, Intel CORP, Google LLC, and Nvidia CORP. CPC classification codes targeted machine learning and neural network technologies (G06N3/08, G06N20/00, G06N3/045) while excluding certain computer vision classifications to maintain focus. These filters yielded a curated subset of 667 patents from hundreds of thousands available.

### 2. Metadata Extraction and API Integration
Initial metadata was exported as lens-export.csv containing essential identifiers, particularly Lens IDs. However, this export lacked critical fields like detailed claims and descriptions. To obtain comprehensive patent data, API access was requested and granted for Lens.org's REST API, enabling automated data retrieval using the collected Lens IDs.

### 3. Automated Data Pipeline Development
A systematic code pipeline was developed to fetch complete patent records via API calls. Data was stored in JSONL format (av_patentdata.jsonl) with each line containing full patent information as delivered by the API, ensuring efficient processing of large datasets while maintaining data integrity.

### 4. Data Preprocessing and Standardization
Raw API data contained extensive nested attributes and irrelevant fields (patent families, legal agents). A preprocessing pipeline was implemented to: remove unnecessary attributes, flatten nested structures to create top-level keys, and ensure consistent attribute availability across all patents. The final standardized schema included nine core attributes: lens_id, date_published, claims, description, earliest_claim_date, applicant_name, cpc_symbols, invention_title_text, and abstract_text.

This structured dataset served as the foundation for subsequent NLP-based clustering and trend analyses, while also providing input for the unstructured-to-structured pipeline feeding downstream ML analyses.

## Methodology for Autonomous Vehicle Patent Technology Clustering

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Corpus Preparation
The analysis begins by loading patent data from the JSONL file and creating a semantic corpus by combining patent titles, abstracts, and claims. Text preprocessing includes cleaning technical references (e.g., "Figure 1" â†’ "figure"), removing excessive whitespace, and truncating documents to 500 words to optimize processing while preserving semantic meaning. Valid documents with sufficient content (>100 characters) are filtered for analysis.

### 2. Semantic Embedding Generation
The Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model transforms patent texts into high-dimensional semantic embeddings that capture contextual meaning beyond simple keyword matching. The 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model generates 384-dimensional vectors with L2 normalization, enabling cosine similarity calculations. This approach captures nuanced technological relationships that traditional TF-IDF methods might miss.

### 3. Optimal Clustering Parameter Selection
Multiple clustering quality metrics guide optimal cluster number selection: silhouette scores measure intra-cluster cohesion versus inter-cluster separation, Calinski-Harabasz scores evaluate cluster variance ratios, and the elbow method identifies diminishing returns in inertia reduction. These metrics are visualized to inform decision-making.

### 4. Semantic Clustering and Validation
K-means clustering groups patents based on semantic similarity in the embedding space. Cluster quality is validated through silhouette scoring and coherence analysis, measuring average cosine similarity within clusters. Alternative methods (hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) provide robustness checks.

### 5. Technology Characterization and Market Analysis
Each cluster is characterized through TF-IDF-based keyword extraction from cluster centroids, identifying representative technological concepts. Cross-cluster similarity analysis reveals technology relationships and potential convergence areas. Patent applicant analysis within clusters identifies market leaders, competitive landscapes, and market concentration using Herfindahl indices.

### 6. Visualization and Reporting
UMAP/t-SNE dimensionality reduction creates interpretable 2D visualizations showing technology landscapes and applicant distributions. Comprehensive reporting includes cluster statistics, technology themes, temporal patterns, leading organizations, and competitive intelligence insights for autonomous vehicle technology domains.

Patent-specific boilerplate language is normalized while preserving technical terminology. Temporal markers are established using the earliest claim dates as the primary timeline reference for trend analysis.

### 2. Meaningful Term Extraction
A multi-layered approach extracts technically relevant terms using both linguistic and domain-specific methods:
- **NLP-based extraction**: Employs spaCy for noun phrase identification and compound term detection while preserving proper grammatical structures
- **Domain-specific pattern matching**: Uses regex patterns to capture AV-specific terminology across domains like perception systems, localization, path planning, V2X communication, and safety standards
- **Technical n-gram analysis**: Identifies 2-3 word combinations with technical relevance based on POS tagging patterns

### 3. Term Filtering and Quality Control
Generic patent language and boilerplate terms are filtered out using comprehensive stopword lists. Terms undergo relevance scoring based on technical keywords, proper phrase structure validation, and awkward phrase detection to ensure meaningful extraction quality.

### 4. Temporal Trend Analysis
Time periods are segmented (yearly/quarterly) with minimum patent thresholds per period. Term frequency normalization by patent count enables fair comparison across periods. Pearson correlation analysis identifies trending (positive correlation) and declining (negative correlation) terms with statistical significance testing.

### 5. Semantic Evolution Analysis
Sentence-BERT embeddings capture semantic relationships between patents within each time period. Cosine similarity measurements between consecutive periods identify significant technological shifts and gradual evolution patterns in the innovation landscape.

### 6. Applicant and Domain Analysis
Top applicants are analyzed for their focus evolution over time using meaningful terms. Domain-specific trend analysis categorizes innovations across key AV technology areas, revealing which domains show strongest growth or decline patterns.

### 7. Visualization and Reporting
Comprehensive visualizations include trending term timelines, semantic evolution plots, applicant activity patterns, and technology shift detection, culminating in detailed reports with statistical insights and strategic implications.

## Methodology for Unstructured to Structured Autonomous Vehicle Patent Data Analysis Pipeline
